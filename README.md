# The Sanguanel web application #

<br/>

This is a personal project that is already done and working at [sanguanel.com](https://sanguanel.com);<br/>
I spent almost exactly one **month** on this entire project.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## About it ##
I was looking to learn Laravel and Vue.JS, so... why not learn these technologies in practice? Of course, I already knew something about them, but nothing compared with what I know now.<br/>
I tried to attach my passion for mead with the knowledge that I was looking for. Now, the project is a web platform with a **database system, a CRUD model, user authentication, an admin system**, and other things that you will see...<br/>
If you want, you can use all of the source code, just (of course) change the brand and theme colors, because it is already a **registered brand**.

## The application ##
The app works as this following way:<br/>
The users have an *admin level* which means how influential the changes they can do at the database are. The importance of this is that all articles and some *homes/subhomes* contents are rendered by using the database.<br/>
The relevance of each level is:<br/>

1. **Level 0 - 2:** Common users without privileges;   
2. **Level 3:** They can see the articles and users database, and require the publishing of an article;
3. **Level 4:** The admin master. Can change any data at DB, any page, and publish any articles;

Here you can see some pages of these admin functions:<br/>
